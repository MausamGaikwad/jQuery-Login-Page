# Log In Page using jQuery
This is a simple login page implemented using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Users can enter their username and password, and upon clicking the "Log In" button, the page will display a success message if the provided credentials match the predefined values ('demo' for username and 'password' for password).

## Project Structure

* style.css: The stylesheet file for styling the login form.
* index.js: The jQuery script for handling the login functionality.
